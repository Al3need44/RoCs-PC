# RoC's PC

Little project I'm working on to go through all the Pokémon games and establish a library in 2016. Yes, some people have done so before me - but this is more of a personal goal to well... Complete the PokeDex.

Though my Pokémon journey started in ~1998, it never really took off until 2006 with the release of Diamond/Pearl. With the GTS and the going online, meeting many like-minded people from communities such as PokemonGTS, ProjectPokemon, ~~and Secure~~, I can see how peaking behind the curtain got me to where I am today.

Still here? Cool. In this thread you can find my collection, amassed since 2006 through my own game-play, The Global Terminal, friends, and more. This includes quite a number of 3rd Gen events (pre-PalParked, see 13 - Gen IV - Gen III Pal Park). I'm still digging through my archive folders so there's probably a lot more, but with the sheer amount of files this will take some time. Also as a disclaimer, it's been so long that I can't tell if any of the events are hacked (especially those GCEA, WISH, etc). I wouldn't assume everything is legit.

I'm working on creating updated 2016 versions of every game's PokeDex since I'm playing through everything from Gen I to VII (#completionist), but you can find my old 2011/2013 5/6th Gen files in zArchive.
